description: "Youtube was on autoplay and this talk by Justin Searls came on title How to Program. It really resonated with my style of thinking and gave me some direction in my goals for improving myself. Here is a summary of the talk."

- School teaches abstract concepts, data structures, big O, cyptography.
- Bootcamps teach frameworks, tooling, web standards, unit/git.
- Thoughleaders teach design patterns, agile scrum,  SOLID principles, TDD/BDD/*DD


Flow? Who teaches us how to program?

Traditionally, guide would start wiht nothing and then give you the final answer, with little explanation how to get there.

Things have gotten a bit better, its broken down into more steps, but is still missing gaps between each step.

Most of us just imitate other programmers.

We need feedback loops.

Do: reflect on actions
Feel: Reflect on feelings.
Think: Reflect on thinknig, better thought processes

Sensitive vs Fearless:

## I prefer hearing all requirements up front, even if I can't tackle them all right away.

Justin: 1 - Disagree, gets overwhelmed easily.

My answer: 4
It helps a lot with planning your architecture.Of course there is no where we will know every use case at the beginning of the project. Project owners will also throw in things later on that they didn't think of at project inception. Its important than to make it so your code is adaptable.

## Adding to a long function feels like more code won't "FIT"

My answer: 5
Better to keep functions short and simple rather than making giant functions.

Justin: 5 - After a certain amount of complexity cant imagine adding more.

## I look forward to being assigned to new projects and teams.

my answer : 3 - Don't like working on the same thing for a long amount of time, like learning new things. This is also a reason I did not like my old job though...

Justin: 1 - New projects give me night sweats.

### I often feel paralyzed while staring at a blank editor screen

my answer: 2 - Start fresh files all the time. Maybe this has to do with all the MVP's I have worked on and have little experience with a large code base.

Justin: 5 - doesnt like starting new.

###Sensitive:

#### Get overwhelmed easily.

Think of all the different tasks we have to make for a project.

**Temptation: Find productivity by putting on blinders. Rabbit hole. That was bottom up programming.**

Top down better, or outside in.

Think from the prospective of the high level component (controller instead of the unit)

What do you need? Then you will know outputs and be minimal.

#### Afraid of failure

**Temptation: Rush to solve, worried I won't finish on time.**

Rush an answer, then someone will look at your code and tell you everything you did wrong. You will feel horrible.

AVOID fear by breaking things down into a systematized way. Give youself help

Discovery testing, reductionism.

Start with test of the top level thing.
