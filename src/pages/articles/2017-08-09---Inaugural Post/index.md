## **Welcome!** 

Welcome to my blog! The goal of it is to document my experiences with software and also double as a reference whenever I need to revisit a problem I've solved.

I tinker with projects outside of work, and while doing so I self teach myself using a combination of official documentation, tutorials, tech talks, eLearning sites, blog posts, and of course a ton of stackoverflow.

I've noticed that in these guides, there is a lot of implied knowledge assumed by the authors. When I first started learning software development, it was quite overwhelming, but now that I have a few apps under my belt, things are a lot more clear. I will do my best to point readers to the background materials in each post so they are as complete as possible.

That's all I have for now, my first development post will cover my experience making a game using GraphQL and Apollo so stay tuned for that!
