description: "I wanted to find a new library to use with my React projects as I was getting tired of the lack of support for Reach with twitter and material ui. A friend of mine tried this library called AntD and I thought I would give it a try. The first line in their introduction summed it up for me: 

\"Following the Ant Design specification, we developed a React UI library antd that contains a set of high quality components and demos for building rich, interactive user interfaces.\"

Finally a library that was made for React, with enterprise quality UI components."
